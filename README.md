Reinforcement learning algorithms

An open source C++ environment to design and train reinforcement learning agents of various types.
Based on DeepLearning project https://github.com/dragunovdenis/DeepLearning (uses the latter as a sub-module).

At the moment, provides functionality to design, train and test agents for playing checkers, including UI that allows interactive playing with a trained agent:

The project is inspired by the brilliant book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton, Richard S. and Barto, Andrew G.
