Reinforcement learning algorithms

An open source C++ environment to design and train reinforcement learning agents of various types.
Based on DeepLearning project https://github.com/dragunovdenis/DeepLearning (uses the latter as a sub-module).

At the moment, the environment provides functionality to design, train and evaluate agents for playing checkers and chess: ![image](https://github.com/dragunovdenis/TrainingCell/assets/4552159/7e57e787-f9d0-4f90-a279-3298407375da) ![image](https://github.com/dragunovdenis/TrainingCell/assets/4552159/652b735e-bf9b-41a1-9562-ba64824644c1) as well as an interface to interactively play with a trained agent ![image](https://github.com/dragunovdenis/TrainingCell/assets/4552159/5becc8e3-0187-4626-bd11-512413df6436) ![image](https://github.com/dragunovdenis/TrainingCell/assets/4552159/f6cd6dc0-a342-4a46-ab1d-2b6be2822128) ![image](https://github.com/dragunovdenis/TrainingCell/assets/4552159/721e8b85-2466-4195-83aa-8d59830766b1)
.

The project is inspired by the brilliant book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton, Richard S. and Barto, Andrew G.
