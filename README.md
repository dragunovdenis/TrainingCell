Reinforcement learning algorithms

An open source C++ environment to design and train reinforcement learning agents of various types.
Based on DeepLearning project https://github.com/dragunovdenis/DeepLearning (uses the latter as a sub-module).

At the moment, the environment provides functionality to design, train and test agents for playing checkers. This includs UI that makes it possible to playing with a trained agent ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4552159/215344977-0bb4a284-eed3-472e-8e20-a1d349a2a264.png) and provides means to train such agents ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4552159/216833918-10bad78d-176a-413d-b2ca-27ad68244e6f.png).

The project is inspired by the brilliant book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton, Richard S. and Barto, Andrew G.
